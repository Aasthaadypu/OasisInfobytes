This is a simple and very easy code for practisioners, and this code helps users to create a very simple UI. 
This is an internship from @OasisInfobytes and their are three tasks in which their is one programming language i.e. java.
In java you can implement all tasks in which users can take advantages of making  a programming language easy and suitable.
Every programming language is easy but users can delve or customize from being away from  hectic schedules.
Depth to high and command of dealing with a kind a details(sub-validated) is very manageable.
Installing some libraries and describing all the interfaces to perform the tasks.
Residing and reconnecting the data to a cool code  is always mangeable.
The theories to look at, is for the coding and writing a descriptive files.
Data-driven approaches are always at a fine-tune because their are data collecting techniques, data- observance is also necessary.
Approaches are variables in this code(User name-IDs,numberofguests, place) solidated and balancing data-group by commands are encapsulated.
APTITUDES: From easy learning to advanced learning.
           Sending group by structures.
           Depth knowledge and throughly read.me files.
           Substituting median terms.
QUESTIONS TO THEORIES: 1) What this output can say about the code?
                       2) Command errors?
Thanks for giving me this opportunity for this internship work.
